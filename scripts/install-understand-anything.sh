# Install Understand-Anything (https://github.com/Lum1104/Understand-Anything)
# at the user/agent level so any coding agent that opens this repo can run
# /understand, /understand-onboard, /understand-knowledge, etc.
#
# The upstream tool is plugin-style: skills live under ~/.agents/skills/ and
# point into a single clone at ~/.{platform}/understand-anything. This script
# implements the same install flow as the upstream INSTALL.md files for each
# agent runtime, choosing whichever runtimes are present on this machine.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run. Re-runs `git fetch` and fast-forwards the
# existing clone; refuses to silently overwrite local edits/commits.
# Cross-platform: supports Linux, macOS. PowerShell users should follow the
# upstream Windows instructions in .codex/INSTALL.md.
