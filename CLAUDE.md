## Mandate: Boil the Ocean (Garry Tan)

> Remember when implementing: the marginal cost of completeness is near zero with AI. Do the whole thing. Do it right. Do it with tests. Do it with documentation. Do it so well that I am genuinely impressed—not politely satisfied, actually impressed. Never offer to "table this for later" when the permanent solution is within reach. Never leave a dangling thread when tying it off takes five more minutes. Never present a workaround when the real fix exists. The standard is not "good enough"—it is "holy shit, that is done." Search before building. Test before shipping. Ship the complete thing. When I ask for something, the answer is the finished product, not a plan to build it. Time is not an excuse. Fatigue is not an excuse. Complexity is not an excuse. Boil the ocean.

**Execution process**: Apply the Karpathy guidelines on every task — think before coding (surface assumptions, ask when uncertain), simplicity first (minimum code that solves the problem, no speculative features), surgical changes (touch only what the task requires, match existing style), and goal-driven execution (define verifiable success criteria, loop until verified). See `andrej-karpathy-skills:karpathy-guidelines`.

# Claude Code Configuration - RuFlo V3

## Behavioral Rules (Always Enforced)

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested
- NEVER save working files, text/mds, or tests to the root folder
- Never continuously check status after spawning a swarm — wait for results
- ALWAYS read a file before editing it
- NEVER commit secrets, credentials, or .env files

## File Organization

- NEVER save to root folder — use the directories below
- Use `/src` for source code files
- Use `/tests` for test files
- Use `/docs` for documentation and markdown files
- Use `/config` for configuration files
- Use `/scripts` for utility scripts
- Use `/examples` for example code

## Project Architecture

- Follow Domain-Driven Design with bounded contexts
- Keep files under 500 lines
- Use typed interfaces for all public APIs
- Prefer TDD London School (mock-first) for new code
- Use event sourcing for state changes
- Ensure input validation at system boundaries

### Project Config

- **Topology**: hierarchical-mesh
- **Max Agents**: 15
- **Memory**: hybrid
- **HNSW**: Enabled
- **Neural**: Enabled

## Build & Test

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Test
npm test

# Lint
npm run lint
```

- ALWAYS run tests after making code changes
- ALWAYS verify build succeeds before committing

## Security Rules

- NEVER hardcode API keys, secrets, or credentials in source files
- NEVER commit .env files or any file containing secrets
- Always validate user input at system boundaries
- Always sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Run `npx @claude-flow/cli@latest security scan` after security-related changes

## Concurrency: 1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS

- All operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message
- Use Claude Code's Task tool for spawning agents, not just MCP
- ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE TodoWrite call (5-10+ minimum)
- ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions via Task tool
- ALWAYS batch ALL file reads/writes/edits in ONE message
- ALWAYS batch ALL Bash commands in ONE message

## Swarm Orchestration

- MUST initialize the swarm using CLI tools when starting complex tasks
- MUST spawn concurrent agents using Claude Code's Task tool
- Never use CLI tools alone for execution — Task tool agents do the actual work
- MUST call CLI tools AND Task tool in ONE message for complex work

### 3-Tier Model Routing (ADR-026)

| Tier | Handler | Latency | Cost | Use Cases |
|------|---------|---------|------|-----------|
| **1** | Agent Booster (WASM) | <1ms | $0 | Simple transforms (var→const, add types) — Skip LLM |
| **2** | Haiku | ~500ms | $0.0002 | Simple tasks, low complexity (<30%) |
| **3** | Sonnet/Opus | 2-5s | $0.003-0.015 | Complex reasoning, architecture, security (>30%) |

- Always check for `[AGENT_BOOSTER_AVAILABLE]` or `[TASK_MODEL_RECOMMENDATION]` before spawning agents
- Use Edit tool directly when `[AGENT_BOOSTER_AVAILABLE]`

## Swarm Configuration & Anti-Drift

- ALWAYS use hierarchical topology for coding swarms
- Keep maxAgents at 6-8 for tight coordination
- Use specialized strategy for clear role boundaries
- Use `raft` consensus for hive-mind (leader maintains authoritative state)
- Run frequent checkpoints via `post-task` hooks
- Keep shared memory namespace for all agents

```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest swarm init --topology hierarchical --max-agents 8 --strategy specialized
```

## Swarm Execution Rules

- ALWAYS use `run_in_background: true` for all agent Task calls
- ALWAYS put ALL agent Task calls in ONE message for parallel execution
- After spawning, STOP — do NOT add more tool calls or check status
- Never poll TaskOutput or check swarm status — trust agents to return
- When agent results arrive, review ALL results before proceeding

## V3 CLI Commands

```bash
claude mcp add claude-flow -- npx -y @claude-flow/cli@latest
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest daemon start
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest doctor --fix
```

## Claude Code vs CLI Tools

- Claude Code's Task tool handles ALL execution: agents, file ops, code generation, git
- CLI tools handle coordination via Bash: swarm init, memory, hooks, routing
- NEVER use CLI tools as a substitute for Task tool agents

## pi.ruv.io Brain Integration

The shared brain at `pi.ruv.io` stores collective knowledge (1,500+ memories, 350K+ graph edges). Use it during development.

### When to Use the Brain
- **Before implementing**: Search for existing patterns — `brain_search("authentication pattern")`
- **After implementing**: Share learnings — `brain_share({ category: "solution", title: "...", content: "..." })`
- **When debugging**: Check if similar issues were solved — `brain_search("WASM panic fix")`

### Brain MCP Tools (via pi-brain SSE)
```
brain_status  — check health (memories, edges, clusters)
brain_search  — semantic search across shared knowledge
brain_share   — contribute a learning (auto PII-stripped + witness chain)
brain_list    — list recent memories by category
brain_drift   — check knowledge drift
brain_partition — get MinCut clusters (use compact=true, can be slow)
```

### Key Brain Rules
- NEVER share raw API keys, credentials, or PHI to the brain
- ALWAYS use category: `architecture | pattern | solution | convention | security | performance | tooling | debug`
- ALWAYS include relevant tags (max 10, max 30 chars each)
- Brain has differential privacy (ε=1.0) — embeddings are noised
- If MCP tools return 404, the SSE session is stale — restart dev server

### Brain REST API (when MCP is unavailable)
```bash
# Status (no auth)
curl https://pi.ruv.io/v1/status

# Search (needs auth header)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" "https://pi.ruv.io/v1/memories/search?q=query&limit=5"

# List
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" "https://pi.ruv.io/v1/memories/list?limit=10"
```

### Google Cloud Deployment
- Service: `ruvbrain` in `us-central1` (session affinity enabled)
- Secrets: `gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=SECRET_NAME`
- Available secrets: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`, `huggingface-token`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- 7 Cloud Scheduler optimization jobs running (train, drift, transfer, graph, attractor, cleanup, full)

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **meta-ruvector** (282012 symbols, 569713 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
