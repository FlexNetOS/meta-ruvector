# Promote the validated trajectory back into ReasoningBank so the next
# iteration starts from a richer memory. This is the closing of the
# self-learning loop.
#
# Full implementation: ReasoningBank::add_trajectory (re-exported by
# `sona`) + a SHAKE-256 witness anchor recorded by
# `crates/prime-radiant/src/execution/gate.rs`.
#
# Stub: writes a single JSONL record per invocation. Output dir is
# $ATTRACTOR_RUN_DIR when set by the runner (so the record colocates
# with that iteration's other artifacts) and falls back to the shared
# .attractor/runs/ when invoked standalone via `attractor.sh node
# distill`. Either way the audit trail is preserved.
